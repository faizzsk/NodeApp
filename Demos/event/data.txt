How and Where NodeJS Internally uses Event Emitters
NodeJs internally uses event emitters widely across its
 environment. The first example we can think of is streams.
Streams extend event emitters. Streams are built on top of 
event emitters that raise predefined events like open, 
end, data, etc.
The following code snippet is a simple example of 
a stream — explaining the resemblance with event emitters.
